    <h1><b><u>About Me</u></b></h1>
    <p>
      <br>
      I'm Pavithra, a freshman at Chennai Institute of Technology pursuing B.E. in Computer Science.<br>
      I was really into computers since primary and how things work behind the scenes.<br>
      CSE seemed exciting and future-proof, so I went for it.
      <br><br><br>
      Iâ€™ve always loved tech and problem-solving.<br>
      CSE felt like the right mix of both and it's a field with endless growth.<br>
      Also I didnâ€™t want to memorize a hundred theory-heavy subjects ðŸ˜… â€”Iâ€™d rather make stuff that actually does something!(Just For Fun)
